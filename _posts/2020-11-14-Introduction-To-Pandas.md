Pandas is a Python package providing high-performance, fast. flexible data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. It has its own data structure. 
In other words, it’s basic use is for data manipulation and data analysis
<br>
<br>

# Commercial uses of pandas

Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields in commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.



# Key Features of Pandas

1.	Fast and efficient DataFrame object.
2.	Tools for loading data into in-memory data objects from different file formats.
3.	Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
4.	Reshaping and pivoting of date sets.
5.	Label-based slicing, indexing and sub setting of large data sets.
6.	Columns from a data structure can be deleted or inserted.
7.	Group by data for aggregation and transformations.
8.	High performance merging and joining of data.
9.	Time Series functionality.
