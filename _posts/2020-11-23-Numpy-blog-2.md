# NumPy Blog - 2

---

**Hola Folks‚Ä¶!** ü§©ü§© It's Time for Another Blog on NumPy. Earlier we saw about What is NumPy, Usability and Advantages. This week we will walk through....

- Applications
- SetUp

## Applications:

NumPy overcomes slower executions with the use of multi-dimensional array objects. It has built-in functions for manipulating arrays. We can convert different algorithms to can into functions for applying on arrays.NumPy has applications that are not only limited to itself. It is a very diverse library and has a wide range of applications in other sectors. Numpy can be put to use along with Data Science, Data Analysis and Machine Learning. It is also a base for other python libraries. These libraries use the functionalities in NumPy to increase their capabilities.

### 1. Shape Manipulations

Users can change array dimensions at runtime if the output produces the same number of elements. We apply

> np.reshape(‚Ä¶)

function on the array. The reshape function is useful for performing various operations.
For eg, we use it when we want to broadcast two dissimilar arrays.

### 2. Array Generation

We can generate array data set for implementing various functions. We can also generate a predefined set of numbers for the array elements using the

> np.arrange(‚Ä¶)

function. Reshape function is useful to generate a different set of dimensions. We can also use the random function to generate an array having random values. Similarly, we can use linspace function to generate arrays having similar spacing in elements. We can create arrays with pre-filled ones or zeroes. The default data type is set to be float64 but we can edit the data type using dtype option.

### 3. Array Dimensions

Numpy consists of both one and multidimensional arrays. Some functions have restrictions on multidimensional arrays. It is then necessary to transform those arrays into one-dimensional arrays. We can transform multi-dimensional to single dimension using

> np.ravel(..)

## Numpy Applications with Other Libraries

### 1. NumPy with Pandas

Pandas is one of the most important libraries in python for data analysis. Pandas provide high performance, fast analysis, and data cleaning. We use it to manipulate data structures and have data analysis tools. It consists of a data frame object. It interoperates with NumPy for faster computations. When we use both the libraries together it is a very helpful resource for scientific computations.

### 2. NumPy with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a module in NumPy. It is a very helpful tool to work with graphical representations. It consists of a wide range of functions to plot graphs and also manipulate them. This combination can replace the functionalities of MatLab. It is used to generate the graphs of the results. We enhance it further with the use of graphic toolkits like PyQt and wxPython.

### 3. NumPy with SciPy

Scipy is an open-source library in Python. It is the most important scientific library in python. It has been built upon the functionalities of NumPy.There are advanced functionalities in SciPy for scientific computations. We can combine it with NumPy for greater mathematical performance. The combination helps in the implementation of complex scientific operations.

### 4. NumPy with Tkinter

Tkinter is a standard library for GUI. We use Tkinter for the GUI representation of the NumPy data. Its combination with NumPy can implement fast and easy GUIs. The use of Tkinter along with NumPy is user friendly. We can easily convert the array objects into image objects.

## How To Install NumPyüôÑ

### Prerequisites

- Access to a **terminal window/command** **line**
- A user account with **sudo** privileges
- **Python** installed on your system

### Step 1: Check Python Version

Before you can install NumPy, you need to know which Python version you have. This programming language comes preinstalled on most operating systems (except Windows; you will need to [Install Python on Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows) manually).

Most likely, you have **Python 2** or **Python 3** installed, or even both versions.

To check whether you have Python , run the command:

> python -\-version

### Step 2: Install Pip

The easiest way to install NumPy is by using Pip. Pip a package manager for installing and managing Python software packages.

Unlike Python, Pip does not come preinstalled on most operating systems. Therefore, you need to set up the package manager that corresponds to the version of Python you have. If you have both versions of Python, install both Pip versions as well.

#### Install Pip on Windows

Install `pip` on Windows uisng `get-pip.py` command and upgrad pip to the latest version:

     python get-pip.py
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip

#### Install Pip on MacOS

Install `pip` on MacOS, using `easy_install` command and upgrade `pip` to the latest version:

     sudo easy_install pip
     sudo pip install --upgrade pip

#### Install Pip in Ubuntu

Install `pip` in Ubuntu, using `apt-get` package manager:

     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python-pip
     sudo pip install--upgrade pip

### Step 3: Install NumPy

With Pip set up, you can use its command line for installing NumPy.

Install NumPy with Python 2 by typing:

```output
pip install numpy
```

Pip downloads the NumPy package and notifies you it has been successfully installed.

To install NumPy with the package manager for Python 3, run:

```output
pip3 install numpy
```

### Step 4: Verify NumPy Installation

Use the **show** command to verify whether NumPy is now part of you Python packages:

```output
pip show numpy
```

And for Pip3 type:

```output
pip3 show numpy
```

The output should confirm you have NumPy, which version you are using, as well as where the package is stored.

### Step 5: Import the NumPy Package

After installing NumPy you can import the package and set an alias for it.

To do so, move to the **python** prompt by typing one of the following commands:

```
python
```

```
python3
```

Once you are in the **python** or **python3** prompt you can import the new package and add an alias for it (in the example below it is **np**):

```
import numpy as np

```

## Upgrading NumPy

If you already have NumPy and want to upgrade to the latest version, for Pip2 use the command:

     pip install --upgrade numpy

If using Pip3, run the following command:

     pip3 install --upgrade numpy
